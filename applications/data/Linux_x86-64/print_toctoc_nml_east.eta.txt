Trying to construct vgrid descriptor from legacy encoding (PT,HY ...)
 Looking for kind=           -1
   Found        58 unique ip1 of kind  1 among the        119 records in file to construct the vertical descriptor
  hybrid (normalized) coordinate found
   More than one HY, checking consistency ...
   All HY consistent.
   Vertical descriptor successfully reconstructed
