To run the tests:

1) Setup the environment and make sure you have created the libvgrid.a
in src:
. setup_{arch+compiler}.dot
make clean
make genlib
make utils

2) cd test_utils; make clean

3) Test all the utilities
./testutilvgrid.sh

All tests must Succeeded

All tests are done in WORK

4) If one or more test fails, debug and rerun it one by one:
Control which test to run by modifying script testutilvgrid.sh 

5) Data set for tests is on Science only: 
/home/sidr000/ords/vgrid_validation_data/1.9.b3
(problem with file dm_5002_from_model_run - removed from test for now)
Maybe dataset can be reproduced using:
driver_to_prepare_tests_files.ksh
