To run the tests:

1) Setup the environment and make sure you have created the libvgrid.a
in src:
. setup_{arch+compiler}.dot
make clean
make genlib
make utils

2) cd test_utils

3) Test all the utilities
./testutilvgrid.sh

All tests must Succeeded

All tests are done in WORK

4) If one or more test fails, debug and rerun it one by one:
Control which test to run by modifying script testutilvgrid.sh 

5) Data set for tests is on Science only: 
ECCI_DATA_DIR : /home/sici000/ci_data/vgrid
(problem with file dm_5002_from_model_run - removed from test for now)
(problem with text comparison in test for print_toctoc with adding !! search
with datev ip3 and etiket. - eliminate almost all tests with diff text files)
Maybe dataset can be reproduced using:
driver_to_prepare_tests_files.ksh
