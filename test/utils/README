Data set for tests is on Science only (ECCI_DATA_DIR=/home/sici000/ci_data/vgrid)

(problem with file dm_5002_from_model_run - removed from test for now)
(problem with text comparison in test for print_toctoc with adding !! search
with datev ip3 and etiket. - eliminate almost all tests with diff text files)
Maybe dataset can be reproduced using:
driver_to_prepare_tests_files.ksh
